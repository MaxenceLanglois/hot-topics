      The importance of money in contemporary society cannot be emphasised. It has a significant impact on our daily lives, influencing our choices and reshaping the world. Money reflects a complex network of social and economic ties that shape our lives and is more than just paper or metal.
      Money is fundamentally an exchange medium that makes interactions between people and organisations easier. Instead of using barter, which would be ineffective and challenging to handle on a big scale, it enables us to trade products and services. Money makes our life simpler by allowing us to specialise in certain professions or industries and by offering a universal language for business transactions.

      GMOs, or genetically modified organisms, have long been a contentious issue in the food industry. GMOs are crops that have been genetically modified to have specific desirable qualities, such higher nutritional value or insect resistance.

      GMO proponents contend that by boosting crop yields and lowering food waste, they can address issues with global food security. They assert that GMOs can enhance crop nutrition and lessen the demand for toxic fertilisers, pesticides, and herbicides.

      However, some who are against GMOs express worries about how they might affect the environment and human health. They contend that GM crops might contain unidentified allergies or poisons that are dangerous to consumers.

      Though making future predictions is always difficult, many experts and scientists have made an effort to imagine what the world might look like in 2100. Climate change, technological development, population expansion, and geopolitical shifts are just a few of the numerous elements that could have an impact on the planet in the next 80 years.

      Climate change will be one of the most important challenges in the globe in 2100. The Earth's temperature is predicted to increase by several degrees Celsius if current patterns continue, which will cause the sea level to rise, more extreme weather events to occur, and significant ecological disturbance. Mass migration, a lack of food and water, and resource-related conflicts could result from this.

      On the other side, a number of technical developments have the potential to positively alter the world.
